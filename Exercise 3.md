# Exercise 3: Hey, it's an app!
#### In this exercise we will put the final touches on our GUI.

## File Input/Output
A very common task in application development is providing the user the means interact with their local file directory.  This could be the ability to browse for local files (input) as well as specify (output) locations for saving files that have been modified or generated by the application.

Based on the previous exercises the Tkinter syntax should be starting to look famiiiar. Below we'll examine the widgets that work together to create our file I/O GUI.

**Label** - let's tell the user what they're looking at
```python
input_label = Label(self.master)
input_label['text'] = 'Input File'
input_label.grid(row=0, column=0)
```

**Entry** - nothing new here...
```python
self.input_entry_box = input_entry_box = Entry(self.master)
input_entry_box['width'] = 50
input_entry_box.grid(row=0,column=1)
 ```

**Button** - finally something I can click!
```python
input_button = Button(self.master)
input_button['text'] = 'BROWSE'
input_button['command'] = self.open_file
input_button.grid(row=0, column=2)
```

These three components form our simple UI.
Notice the `command` attribute on the button. Well, this next a The following method ties it


## Tkinter File Browsing:
The example below is a class that utilizes all of the code we wrote in Exercise 1, but formatted as a class.
```python
from Tkinter import *

class App():

  # Create class-level attribute Tk instance

  def __init__(self):

    # Execute core methods
    pass

  def config_app(self):

    # Configure main window
    pass

  def config_widgets(self):

    # Insert widgets
    pass

  def run_app(self):

    # Enter the Tkinter event loop
    pass

new_window = App()
```
## General Workflow:
The general workflow remains the same:
1. Import **all** from Tkinter.
2. Define the class name as **App**.
3. Create Tk **root** window widget as a class-level attribute.
4. In the **init** method, we run the core methods
    - configure app
    - configure widgets
    - run app

#### Take the code from Exercise 1 and slot it into the appropriate places in the above skeleton code template.
#### Running the code again, it should create the same app, now just a bit more classy behind the scenes.
