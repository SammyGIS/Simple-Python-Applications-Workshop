# Simple-Python-Applications-Workshop
Using a stand alone graphic user interface (GUI) allows for the development of powerful apps that can utilize a wide variety of GIS software and can be easily shared cross-platform. This workshop will teach you the basics of creating stand alone GUI’s for your Python scripts using the Tkinter native Python package. In this workshop, you will learn the necessary Python concepts for creating Tkinter GUI’s, including classes and modules, as well as how to utilize the many widgets available in the Tkinter package. We will also create several simple GIS tools with the Tkinter GUI and discuss tool sharing best practices. You’ll leave with the skills and knowledge necessary for creating your own stand alone Python app!
